Project 2: Binary Search Tree

To compile the program:
make compile

To run test1.txt:
make run
To run test2.txt:
make run2
To run test3.txt:
make run3
To run test4.txt:
make run4
To run test5.txt:
make run5
To run insertOnlyTest.txt:
make run6
To run insertDeleteTest.txt:
make run7
To run additional txt files:
./proj2 [fileName with .txt extension]

To clean the program executable:
make clean

Note: The visualization prints out all empty nodes with a "x".
It may block the program printout. To fix this, maximize the terminal window
on mac, or putty window on windows. This should allow all program print up to 
show up by scrolling up the window.

Thanks,
Vincent
