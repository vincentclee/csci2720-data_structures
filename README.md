The course instructor reserves the right to further curve grades based on overall grade distributions; however, any
such curve will not reduce any student’s grade. Students must be officially registered for this course in order to
attend class and to receive any grades.

####Tentative Exam Dates
Midterm Exam: July 2rd, 1:00 pm to 3:15 pm in our scheduled classroom
Final Exam: August 1nd, 3:30 pm to 6:30 pm in our scheduled classroom

####Attendance Policy
You are expected to attend all classes during the semester. If you are not able to attend a class, then it is your
responsibility to find out what was covered during the class and to catch up.
If you are absent due to extreme circumstances such as a family emergency, serious illness/injury, or other
significant event, please contact your instructor as soon as possible.

####Email Policy
 To email the instructor or TA, students are required to use their official UGAmail address, and the subject of a
student email to an instructor must include a [cs2720] tag. Emails from addresses outside of UGA or emails that are
lacking the proper subject tag may not be received or answered. Typically, the instructor and TA will reply to
students’ emails within 48 hours Monday through Friday. During the weekends and University holidays, emails will
be answered at the instructor’s or TA’s discretion.

Email communication should NOT be seen as an alternative to meeting with the instructor (or the TA) during office
hours. Email will not be used to provide private tutorials or to explain material that was covered in classes you
missed. If an email question cannot briefly be answered with a reply email, the instructor will indicate to the student
that she or he should see the instructor (or TA) during the announced office hours or make an appointment.

####Programming Policy
All programming projects and some parts of homeworks must be written in C++, and all C++ source code must
compile using the g++ compiler located in /usr/bin on nike.cs.uga.edu (nike). To submit a program, put its source
code, its makefile, and its readme file in a single directory (the name of the directory will given in a homework’s or
project’s directions) on nike, and use the submit utility to submit the directory to the cs2720 account on nike.
Programs must have a readme file that states what the project does and how to compile and run it. Also, programs
must have a makefile that includes at least three working directives: compile, run, and clean. The first and default
compile directive should compile all source code, the run directive should run an example of the program, and the
clean directive should remove all compiled code.

After submitting a directory, you are responsible for checking if the submission was successful by checking if a file
beginning with “rec” was created in the submitted directory. The “rec” file will show a record of all files submitted
along with their timestamps. If a “rec” file does not appear in the directory after submitting it, then the submission
was unsuccessful, and you must resubmit. If you cannot submit a project or homework via nike, then email your
source code to the instructor before its deadline. Students are responsible for saving and backing up their source
code. Students are also responsible for checking that their programs compile and run correctly on nike.

####Regrading Policy
A regrade request must be made to the instructor or TA during scheduled office hours within one week of the date
that the grade was posted in eLC. This rule applies to any grade recorded by the course instructor or TA throughout
the semester. Students are responsible for checking their grades on eLC on a regular basis. After the last class
lecture, no regrade requests and no late work will be accepted.
Makeup Exam and Final Exam Policies

No makeup exams will be given. If you are absent the day of an exam due to extreme circumstances such as a
family emergency, serious illness/injury, or other significant event, please contact your instructor as soon as
possible. Under this scenario, you must provide a copy of detailed documentation to your instructor within one
week regarding the reason for your absence. The instructor has the right to decide whether or not to excuse an exam
absence. Typically, notes from the health center or doctor’s office that state something like “the student was seen at
this date/time” are not considered as detailed documentation that would excuse an exam absence. If you are excused
by the instructor, your grade for the missed exam will be the same grade that you receive on the final exam. If you
are not excused by the instructor, your exam grade will be a zero. The final exam must be taken at the scheduled
time and place; however, if you must reschedule the final exam per University policy, then you must petition the
instructor at least one week before the final exam is scheduled.

###Academic Honesty Policy
All students are responsible for maintaining the highest standards of honesty and integrity in every phase of their
academic careers. The penalties for academic dishonesty are severe and ignorance is not an acceptable defense.
You must abide by the University Honor Code and the Academic Honesty Policy. All academic work must meet the
standards contained in “A Culture of Honesty”. Students are responsible for informing themselves about those
standards before performing any academic work.

In addition, you are expected to have read and understood the CS Academic Integrity policies. Furthermore, all of
your course work, including homeworks and projects, are to be strictly your own work. You can talk over general
principles and concepts about an assignment with others, but copying, sharing materials, or even looking at, another
student’s solutions or code, either on paper, on the computer or whiteboard, is not allowed.
CS Academic Integrity policies:

* Read “A Culture of Honesty”, the UGA academic honesty policies and CS Academic Integrity policies.
* You must not allow others to copy or look at your work.
* Do not write code for others, and don't have others write code for you. All the programming assignments in
CSCI 1301 are to be your own work unless otherwise explicitly stated on the assignment.
* You must not give/share your lab/project assignment work to a fellow student.
* Copying significant portions of code from a fellow student or any other source (including internet) is
plagiarism and will be dealt with as such.
* If you have questions about an assignment or if you run into problems, contact your instructor/lab
instructor.
* During exams, no assistance and no additional materials are allowed.

All of your coursework must meet the aforementioned policies and rules. Students that violate any of these rules or
the UGA Academic Honesty policies will be liable to a penalty. The instructor will strictly enforce Academic
Honesty policies and report any violation of the aforementioned policies and rules. Furthermore, the instructor and
TA have the right to run plagiarism detection software on submitted work throughout the semester.
